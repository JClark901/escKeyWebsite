          <h3>A little about me...</h3>
          <br>
          <p><h5 class="aboutUsP">At 19 I was a computer science major until I decided to accept the opportunity to become the 
            manager at the bar I was working for in college. I spent 20+ years as the General Manager 
            and Managing Partner of several successful corporate restaurants. As amazing as that career 
            path was, I have often looked back and regretted not finishing my CS degree and becoming a 
            developer. Being a restaurant leader is a great career for a young single man, however I am 
            no longer either of those things. As a matter of fact, not only did I marry the woman of my 
            dreams but we were also blessed with 4 beautiful children. The hours required by my career 
            became a strain on myself and my family as I was working nearly every holiday, weekend, and 
            long hours the rest of the time. I often wished I could just hit the {esc Key} on life and 
            enjoy as much time with my beautiful family as any person with a “normal job”.</h5> </p>
            <br>
            <h3>A little about Dani...</h3>
            <br>
            <p><h5 class="aboutUsP">
              Dani is a natural born artist. She looks at the world a little differently than the rest of us. 
              Dani is the co-founder and owner of a successful children’s boutique dress company where she designs 
              and hand sews beautiful creations. All the while, she somehow still manages to take care of me and 
              our beautiful children. With her skills as a designer and her creative nature, she is able to take 
              my code and turn our websites into works of art.

            <p><h5 class="aboutUsP">
              So, we decided it was time to take our lives and future into our own hands. We formed escKey! 
              I have taken several accredited online courses on Web Development (150+ hours) and Dani has done the same 
              for Graphic Design. We continue to learn and grow in these areas. Together we aspire to take 
              our clients vision for their web site and turn it into beautiful, fully functional sites that 
              more than returns your investment. We would love to make clients for life and be able to 
              continue to fulfill your development and graphic design needs as we grow in our craft.
